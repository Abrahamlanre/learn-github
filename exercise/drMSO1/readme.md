## KaTeX

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https## SmartyPants
SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:
|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         ||----------------|:-------------------------------:|-----------------------------:||Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            ||Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            ||Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
